Will this Studio only for Manga and Comic??<br>
<b> No </b><br>
To check for the upcoming comic plans, <a href="unti.html"> click here </a> <br>
Our Studio for now, our primary goal is to make Comics and Manga for now but, with enough support and success, our Studio will surely tap into these fields provided below:
<OL Type = "A">
<li> Animations: Obviously with enough budget, we will be making animated series as some of the project is very limited to be portrayed in still images in comics and manga.
With the help of visual illustration, the director can portray what he truly wants to show the audience.<br>
There will be types of animations too: </li>
<Ul type = "circle">
<li> Anime style: One of the most popular animating style in the world. </li>
<li> Catoonish style: Not childish but colorful drawing style will be implemented <li>
<li> Semi-Realistic: Rotoscoping will be used in this process. <br>
(If you are unaware of Rotoscoping, click the wikipedia link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping"> Rotoscoping </a>
<li> 3D Animation: Animating with 3D models, can make it very realistic too. </li>
</ul>
<li> Movies: Yup, you heard/saw it right, with enough budget and popularity, we will definately make movies about some of the stories like Distortion, Eclipse, etc. </li>
<li> Games: Currently, our studio have 3 games in pending that we can make in future.</li>
<ol type ="1">
<li> Relapsed: A Recurring Present :- A story driven choices game that is highly inspired from the Lapse game series. Here you are appointed as the new President of the U.D.U which is one of the 
last standing countries of the entire world. Try to survive as long as you can and see how you serve for the people. </li>
<li> Wrath of Nature:- An online/offline rpg survival action packed game.</li>
<li> No Land for Undead (N.L.D):- A zombie survival horror multiplayer game dedicated for the studio.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
