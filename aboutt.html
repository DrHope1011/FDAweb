F.D.A Studio or Felcon Digital Art Studio, is an indie studio for creating various Manga, Comic like projects. <br>
It is an indie studio, founded by Leiphaba and Gilbert. Initially, the studio started as a group chat for personal development, created by Leiphaba on March 3, 2024 with the name of the group being "Lookmaxing(summer)".

The earliest member of the studio consisted of Leiphaba, Gilbert, Uttaraj and Victor (ex-member of the studio). <br>
After Gilbert, proposed the idea for making a studio for making manga and comic, all the members were assigned with their own jobs for making the process more easier. <br>
Gilbert is the main story writer, blue print maker for the comics, meanwhile Leiphaba is the main background executive, and also a story writer. Victor was given a task for smoothening of the art, while Uttaraj would do coloring.
Victor and Uttaraj had to leave the group for moving on with their lives. A new member, Mangal was added for doing coloring, but the members were still very little. Mangalsana and Pareihanba (Ex-member) were added in the group.
The Group first began to step foot on a project in which a vigilante rises up against the corruption of the country, inspired by Bhavesh Joshi Superhero and Batman. They began to work on "Eclipse: A Vengeful Ninja"<br>

The project planning took them 5 months to make the first half of Eclipse, in process, a new member was added into the group, Renu. She was directed to do the text editing along with Mangalsana, an all rounded assistant, as she helped with the story, drawing, etc.<br>
The studio planned to show their existence to the entire world by making their presense public through many social media platforms like Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. <br>
However, the plan backfired as non of the members were that good or fluent in English, whether in writing or speaking, and making an impression towards the audience is crucial, hence they dropped the idea as they felt unprepared.<br>
Their attention towards Eclipse, started to fade away since the story was getting longer and complicated as they proceed. They decided to post-poned it to 2025 (This year). They began to face problems in which comic to make, they initially agreed to work on
"Symbiosis: Scarcity of Humanity" (To know more, <a href="unti.html">Click here</a>, however the lack of story telling, made them to post-poned it too. Then, their last project before suspension of their work due to HSLCE 2025 was "Distortion" (To know more, <a href="unti.html">Click here</a>)
But as they approach November, the group decided to suspend their work till the HSLCE 2025 is finished.
